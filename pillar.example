                No service will be given on this subnet, but declaring it helps the
                DHCP server to understand the network topology.

                This declaration allows BOOTP clients to get dynamic addresses, 
                which we don't really recommend.

                Hosts which require special configuration options can be listed in
                host statements.   If no address is specified, the address will be 
                allocated dynamically (if possible), but the host-specific information
                will still come from the host declaration.

                Fixed IP addresses can also be specified for hosts.   These addresses
                should not also be listed as being available for dynamic assignment.
                Hosts for which fixed IP addresses have been specified can boot using
                BOOTP or DHCP.   Hosts for which no fixed address is specified can only
                be booted with DHCP, unless there is an address range on the subnet
                to which a BOOTP client is connected which has the dynamic-bootp flag
                set.

                You can declare a class of clients and then do address allocation
                based on that.   The example below shows a case where all clients
                in a certain class get addresses on the 10.17.224/24 subnet, and all
                other clients get addresses on the 10.0.29/24 subnet.
